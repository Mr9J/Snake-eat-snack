          This is a simple web-based version of the Snake game. It's created
          using JavaScript.
          <br />
          <br />
          You can control the snake using the arrow keys on your keyboard or the
          WASD keys.
          <br />
          There is a switch located below the "Game Start" button. You can use
          this switch to select the game difficulty.
          <br />
          In the easy mode, the snake doesn't immediately die upon hitting the
          wall; instead, it reappears from the opposite side of the wall.
          <br />
          Under the normal difficulty setting, just like typical Snake game, if
          the snake's head hits the wall, game over.
          <br />
          Your highest score is recorded and stored in Local Storage.
